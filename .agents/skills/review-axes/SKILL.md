description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes: Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating ticket or spec asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."
---

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating ticket or spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

Specs default to **local markdown**: a spec or ticket file under `.scratch/` or `docs/`, which needs no setup. Only when the spec lives in a remote tracker (GitHub/GitLab) do you need `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`; run `/setup-skills` to configure it.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside two parallel sub-agents.

**Working-tree mode.** When the fixed point is given as the *unstaged working tree* (the caller says "the unstaged working tree", "my uncommitted changes", or similar) the changes under review were never committed, so no ref can name them:

- The diff command is plain `git diff` (working tree vs. index). There is no commit list.
- Skip the `git rev-parse` check; there's no ref to resolve. Still fail on an empty diff.
- Run `git add -N .` first so newly created files show up in `git diff`, without it they are invisible and the review silently passes over whole new files.

This is the mode `/implement` and `/delegate-tickets` use, since neither commits. In `/delegate-tickets` the index deliberately holds earlier tickets' work, so `git diff` isolates exactly the current ticket. Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git reset` in this mode beyond the `git add -N .` above.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. A path the user passed as an argument.
2. A spec file under `.scratch/`, `docs/`, or `specs/` matching the branch name or feature: the default home for local-markdown specs.
3. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.): fetch via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` (only when a remote tracker is configured).
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: a fixed set of Fowler code smells (*Refactoring*, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with two parallel sub-agent calls (`Agent` in Claude Code, `Task` in Cursor). Use the `general-purpose` / `generalPurpose` subagent for both.

**Pick the model by host** (keep this review cheap):

| Host | Model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | `model: haiku`, `effort: medium` | Haiku only on Claude Code. |
| **Cursor** | `model: claude-4.5-haiku-thinking` | Task rejects `composer-2.5` (Standard). Only Composer slug allowed is `composer-2.5-fast` (~6× cost), skip it. Use Haiku for cheap parallel reviews when the parent chat is AUTO. |

**Standards sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. If the spec has markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), also list each checkbox criterion as **done** or **not done** based on the code in the diff, not on intent. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings: the two axes are deliberately separate (see *Why two axes*).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue *within each axis* (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

### 6. Sync acceptance-criteria checkboxes

After the Spec report, update the **local markdown** spec/ticket source (the file from step 2: typically under `.scratch/`, `docs/`, or `specs/`) so its checkboxes match what the code actually did:

- Flip `- [ ]` → `- [x]` only when that criterion is implemented in the diff / codebase (use the Spec sub-agent's done/not-done list; verify against the diff when unsure).
- Leave `- [ ]` (or flip `- [x]` → `- [ ]`) when the criterion is missing, partial, or wrong per Spec.
- Edit existing checkbox lines only: do not add, delete, or rewrite criterion text.
- Skip this step when there is no local markdown spec, the spec has no checkboxes, or the Spec axis was skipped.
- Do **not** commit these markdown edits unless the user asks.

If the spec/ticket file has a `Status:` line (see `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`) and, after the flip above, **every** acceptance-criteria checkbox is `- [x]`, advance `Status:` to `ready-for-human`: implementation is done and the work now needs human review before it merges. Leave `Status:` untouched when any checkbox remains unchecked, or when the file has no `Status:` line.

Tell the user briefly which boxes changed (checked / unchecked) and whether `Status:` was advanced, so they can see progress at a glance.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
